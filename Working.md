This code performs simple linear regression using NumPy and then evaluates the model's performance by calculating the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE). Let's break down the code step by step: 
•	Import Libraries: The code begins by importing the required libraries, including NumPy and Matplotlib. 
•	Define Data: Two arrays, X and y, are defined. X represents the independent variable, while y represents the dependent variable. These arrays contain some sample data for demonstration purposes. 
•	Define the Simple Linear Regression Function: The simple_linear_regression function takes X and y as input and calculates the slope (m) and intercept (c) of the regression line using the least squares method. 
•	Fit the Model: The simple_linear_regression function is called with X and y to obtain the slope (m) and intercept (c) of the regression line. 
•	Make Predictions: Using the obtained slope (m) and intercept (c), predictions (y_pred) are made for each value of X. 
•	Calculate RMSE: The Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) is calculated to evaluate the performance of the model. RMSE is a measure of the differences between values predicted by a model and the observed values. 
•	Plot the Data and Regression Line: Matplotlib is used to create a scatter plot of the data points (X, y) and overlay the regression line (y_pred). This visualization helps in understanding how well the regression line fits the data. 
•	Display the Plot: Finally, the plot is displayed. 
This code essentially demonstrates a simple linear regression model from scratch and visualizes its performance. It's a great way to understand the fundamentals of linear regression and how it can be implemented using NumPy.
