•	Import libraries: We import necessary libraries from Keras. 
•	Hyperparameters: Define hyperparameters like sequence length, embedding dimension, and LSTM units.
•	Data Preparation: This section would involve cleaning and preparing your text data for the model. 
•	Model Definition: 
  o	Embedding layer converts words into numerical representations (embeddings). 
  o	Two LSTM layers with return_sequences=True in the first layer allow learning longer dependencies in the text. 
  o	Dense layer with softmax activation predicts the probability of the next word in the sequence. 
•	Model Compilation: We choose the categorical crossentropy loss function for multi-class classification and the Adam optimizer for training. 
•	Model Training: This section would involve training the model on your prepared data. 
•	Text Generation: This section would use the trained model to generate new text sequences by feeding it a starting sequence and predicting the next words based on the model's learned patterns.
