•	Import Libraries: We import necessary libraries for text processing, data manipulation, and building the neural network.
•	Hyperparameters: Define hyperparameters like maximum sequence length, vocabulary size, embedding dimension, and LSTM units.
•	Data Preparation: This section (not shown) would involve loading your text data (reviews), cleaning it (removing punctuation, stop words), and converting them into numerical sequences using tokenization.
•	Tokenizer: We create a Tokenizer object that learns a vocabulary of the most frequent words (up to vocab_size). It then converts text reviews into sequences of integer indices corresponding to the words in the vocabulary.
•	Padding: We pad sequences to a fixed length (max_len) using pad_sequences to ensure consistent input for the model.
•	Labels: We define labels (0 for negative, 1 for positive) based on the sentiment of each review.
•	Model Definition:
  o	Embedding layer converts words into numerical representations (embeddings).
  o	LSTM layer captures long-term dependencies in the sequence to understand sentiment.
  o	Dense layer with sigmoid activation predicts the probability of a positive sentiment (between 0 and 1).
•	Model Compilation: We choose binary crossentropy loss for binary classification (positive or negative) and the Adam optimizer for training.
•	Model Training: We train the model on the prepared sequences and labels for a specific number of epochs (iterations). A validation split helps monitor performance on unseen data during training.
•	Model Evaluation: We evaluate the model's accuracy on a separate test set to assess its generalizability.
